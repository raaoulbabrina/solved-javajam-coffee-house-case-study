In this chapterâ€™s case study, you will use the existing JavaJam website (Chapter 11) as a starting point to create a new version of the website that implements the description meta tag on each page. You have three tasks in this case study:

<ol>

 <li>Create a new folder for this JavaJam case study.</li>

 <li>Write a description of the JavaJam Coffee House business.</li>

 <li>Code a description meta tag on each page in the website.</li>

</ol>

Task 1: Create a folder called ch12javajam to contain your JavaJam Coffee House website files. Copy the files from the Chapter 11 Case Study ch11javajam folder.

Task 2: Write a Description. Review the JavaJam Coffee House pages that you created in earlier chapters. Write a brief paragraph that describes the JavaJam Coffee House site. Edit the paragraph down to a description that is only a few sentences and less than 25 words in length.

Task 3:

Update Each Page. Open each page in a text editor and add a description meta tag to the head section. Save the files and test them in a browser. They will not look different, but they are much friendlier to search engines!
